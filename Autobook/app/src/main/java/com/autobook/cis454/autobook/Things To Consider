This is just a file for us to keep track of our thoughts of things we should consider when programming

1. We should probably cache the list of Friends for FB and Twitter and set an update schedule for the (e.g. every minute or so)

2. There's a limit on the amount of times you can post using Twitter (about 15 times every 15 minutes).

3. Checking for an internet connection is a valid concern. However, as the code currently stands, if it doesn't detect an internet connection, it will just completely stop running and will never
    restart the process. Need to change that so it checks every X amount of time. I've commented it out for now as it interferes with testing. -KG
